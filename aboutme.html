<h1> My story </h1>
<p> Hi, I'm a seventeen years old student. I'm studing at the moment, my
  aim is to graduate, but I'm also developing a great interest in programming
  and studing everytime I can. I hope to have the possibility to work with big
  companies someday, but until that moment just wanna keep on improving my skills
  and creating better websites day after day.

  <h1> My skills </h1>
  <p>
  I am a quiet person, I have excellent concentration skills, which I can
   maintain for very long periods of time, I also have good organizational
   skills and I can manage teamwork. I learn quite quickly and this allows
    me to try my hand at projects unknown to me.
